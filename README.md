# WIP Project
# ELK Stack Provisioning

This repo is a Ansible project to provision an ELK machine to log monitoring.

We use the roles of [this other](https://github.com/DanielBerman/ansible-elk-playbook) Ansible ELK project and add some configuration of NGINX and HTPASSWD to manage the acces to the instance.
